# ChallengeWk4

## Be competent in the use of Ansible to automate a sequence of tasks

### What was the challenge? 

- The challenge was to automate Ansible to install Docker on the local machine. In this case we were given instructions on how Docker is normally installed as we have only used an installation wizard in the past. The normal method of docker installation involves several steps that include:

      *apt-transport-https installation
      *ca-certificates
      *curl
      *software-properties-common
      *addition of the Docker apt key
      *addition of a docker apt repository
      *installation of docker-ce through apt

### How I expected the challenge to go. 

- This challenge was really fulfilling as we had some excellent demos to refer to. Over the past few weeks the challenges have become technically more complex but feel less difficult to accomplish. This is a reflection of the effective tuition we have experienced and has provided a great boost to confidence.

### What went well? 

- Creating the *playbook.yaml* was great fun, I had to do some research online to find out how best to install the dependencies but the rest was quite straightforward. 

### What didn't go as planned? 

- Initially the playbook seemed to be quite complex and after some trial and error running failed playbooks the correct formats were determined. Also the inclusion of the docker installation instructions was a great help when creating the playbook.

### Possible improvements for future challenges.

- Future challenges maybe improved by perhaps giving a little extra time before the deadline. Fridays tend to have multiple meetings scattered throughout the day taking up anywhere between 2-3 hours.
